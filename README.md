SnakeAudry

This program is an enhanced version of a basic snake game created by my instructor Clara James.
I added the ability to: 
pass through the edge and appear on the other side (//warp walls),
create blocks that if hit cause game over (//maze walls)
change the speed (//speed)
change the screen size (//screen)
have the snake segments to appear in rainbow colors (//rainbow snake)
